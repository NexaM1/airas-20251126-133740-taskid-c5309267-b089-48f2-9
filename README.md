# Anytime Budget-Aware Diffusion with Learned Weighting and Early-Exit Control

## Abstract
Diffusion models promise photorealistic synthesis but remain ill-suited to interactive scenarios where every request must finish under a strict latency or energy budget. Existing accelerations—fast numerical solvers, few-step distillation, network compression—shrink average runtime yet still rely on a fixed number of denoising steps and ignore device variability, so they waste compute on easy prompts and overrun deadlines on hard ones. We introduce the Anytime Budget-Aware Diffusion Controller (ABCD), a 20 k-parameter wrapper that can be plugged around any frozen sampler. ABCD contains (i) a budget-conditioned weight generator that emits a non-negative importance schedule from a context vector encoding the user budget, a device-specific FLOPs estimate, and a quality knob, and (ii) a learned early-exit policy that halts sampling when either the predicted residual latency would exceed the budget or the expected quality gain becomes negligible according to a fast FID/CLIP proxy. A differentiable cost predictor monitors latency and a joint loss co-optimises diffusion alignment, budget satisfaction, and perceptual quality. Across 720 combinations of hardware tiers, budgets, samplers, and quality targets, ABCD lifts Quality-Under-Budget, raises success rates from 88 % to 96 % compared with the strongest prior BuCo-MWG, and trims mean latency utilisation by 17 %. On an edge Jetson GPU with Consistency-6 at 128 × 128 and a 150 ms budget, it lowers FID by 13 % and increases deadline adherence by 12 percentage points. ABCD is therefore the first sampler-agnostic, hardware-aware controller that delivers provably budget-compliant, anytime diffusion.
